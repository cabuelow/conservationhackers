### Data wrangling of ecological data in R with ecological examples

With Drs Chris Brown and Christina Buelow

$75.00 general/$50.00 student (GST inclusive)

This course 3 hour course will cover the basics of pre-processing ecological survey data to calculate some common ecological indicators.

We'll be using the Reef Life Survey Rottnest Island data as an example.

This is not a course for absolute R beginners. At a minimum you should have R and R studio installed on your computer and know your way around R's console (e.g. how to install packages, read in data and make simple plots).

Unfortunately we won't have time in the course to help attendees install R or its packages on their own computers so please come with those already installed.

We'll work assuming this basic knowledge and teach you how to: identify and correct common mistakes in fish survey data, plot the data, join survey level data to site level data and summarize the data to calculate some important ecological indicators of fishing and climate pressures.

The course will be held on October 22nd from 9-12 pm AEST.
