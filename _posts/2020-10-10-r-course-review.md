# A review of free conservation and ecology R tutorials

Do you ever find yourself sitting at your computer with R open, keen to get started on some analysis, but not sure how? Perhaps you want to clean your data first and do some exploration. Or perhaps you have a specific question in mind, but you’re not sure what analysis to do to find the answer.  

So next you try surfing the web a bit, to find some help. It turns out there are a lot of excellent (and free!) R resources online.  


To make the process of finding help easier, we’ve compiled a list of free online R tutorials with a conservation and ecology focus. We provide a comparison of the content available in each. The aim is to help you quickly find answers to your R queries, whether it be data wrangling, spatial analysis, or more complex statistical procedures.

The database will remain a live document [insert link, maybe google spreadsheet?]. We encourage anyone reading this post to add to the database with any tutorials we may have missed.  

[Here display information on online tutorials:

Ideas:  

Just display as a table similar to the review spreadsheet

Or do an interactive plot, where you can select the topic/analysis you’re interested in from drop-down list (e.g. wrangling, spatial analysis, GLM), and see what resources are available

….others?]



[Here maybe make a concluding statement on what we think the major gaps are for free online tutorials]
